# BTPS: Billing Trust Protocol Secure

**BTPS** is an open, trust-based protocol for secure, cryptographically verifiable billing and invoice communication. It is designed to stop invoice fraud, automate onboarding, and enable secure, auditable, and interoperable billing workflows across SaaS, fintech, and enterprise platforms.

## üåç What is BTPS?

BTPS (Billing Trust Protocol Secure) is a next-generation protocol for exchanging billing and financial documents securely between organizations. It combines the best of email-like addressing, DNS-based identity, and modern cryptography to ensure that only trusted, verified parties can send and receive sensitive billing information.

- **Email-like addressing:** Use familiar addresses like `billing$vendorcorp.com` to send and receive documents.
- **Trust-based delivery:** Only approved senders can deliver bills/invoices to your platform‚Äîno more spam or fraud.
- **Cryptographic security:** Every message is signed, encrypted, and verifiable end-to-end.
- **Automated onboarding:** DNS and `.well-known` records make trust establishment and key rotation seamless.
- **Open and extensible:** Integrate with any backend, database, or workflow using the open SDK.

## üöÄ Quickstart

```sh
npm install @btps/sdk
```

```js
import { BtpsServer, BtpsClient } from '@btps/sdk';

// Start a BTPS server
const server = new BtpsServer({
  /* ...options... */
});
server.start();

// Send a BTPS message
const client = new BtpsClient({
  /* ...options... */
});
await client.sendInvoice({
  /* ...invoice data... */
});
```

See [docs/SERVER](docs/docusaurus//docs/server/overview.md) and [docs/CLIENT](docs/docusaurus/docs/client/overview.md) for full usage.

## üîß Operations & Production

### Monitoring and Observability

BTPS provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities for production deployments:

- **Trust Store Monitoring:** Track trust relationships, expirations, and key rotations
- **Message Delivery Metrics:** Monitor delivery success rates, latency, and error patterns
- **Security Auditing:** Log all cryptographic operations, trust changes, and access attempts
- **Performance Metrics:** Track server performance, connection pools, and resource utilization
- **Compliance Reporting:** Generate audit trails and compliance reports for regulatory requirements

### Scaling and High Availability

- **Multi-Region Deployment:** Deploy BTPS servers across multiple regions for global coverage
- **Load Balancing:** Use the `btpsFactory` and `btpsRegistry` for orchestrating multiple servers
- **Database Integration:** Scale trust stores with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or cloud databases
- **Caching Strategies:** Implement caching for DNS lookups, trust records, and cryptographic operations
- **Auto-Scaling:** Automatically scale servers based on message volume and performance metrics

### Security Operations

- **Key Management:** Automated key rotation, secure key storage, and access controls
- **Threat Detection:** Monitor for suspicious patterns, failed verification attempts, and potential attacks
- **Incident Response:** Automated alerts and response procedures for security incidents
- **Compliance Monitoring:** Ensure adherence to security policies and regulatory requirements
