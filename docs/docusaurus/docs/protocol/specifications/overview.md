# BTPS Protocol Specifications

## Overview

The BTPS (Billing Trust Protocol Secure) specification defines a standardized protocol for secure, trust-based document exchange between organizations. This protocol establishes cryptographic identity verification, trust management, and secure message transmission to prevent invoice fraud and enable automated, auditable billing workflows. BTPS uses DNS-based identity resolution, public-key cryptography, and TLS transport to create a federated network where only trusted parties can exchange sensitive billing documents.

## Core Protocol Components

### Identity & Discovery

- **DNS-based Identity Resolution**: Public keys and server endpoints published via DNS TXT records
- **Cryptographic Verification**: All messages signed and verified using public-key cryptography
- **Trust Management**: Explicit trust relationships required before document exchange

### Message Security

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Sensitive documents encrypted with AES-256-CBC
- **Digital Signatures**: SHA-256 signatures for message authenticity and integrity
- **TLS Transport**: All communication secured with TLS 1.3

### Document Types

- **Trust Requests**: Establish trust relationships between organizations
- **Trust Responses**: Accept, reject, or block trust requests
- **Invoices**: Secure billing documents with line items and payment details

## Identity Address Format

BTPS uses email-like addressing for organizational identities:

```
<username>$<domain>
```

**Examples:**

- `billing$vendorcorp.com`
- `pay$client.com`
- `accounts$enterprise.org`
- `subdomain.accounts$vendor.com`
- `pay.john$vendor.com`

---

## üîê DNS TXT Identity Record (Public Key)

Used to discover the **public key** and signing/encryption metadata for an identity.

### Naming Convention

```
<selector>._btps.identity.<identityName>.<domain>
```

**Example:**

```
btps1._btps.identity.finance.vendorcorp.com
```

### TXT Record Format

```
v=1.0.0; k=<key_type>; p=<base64_public_key>
```

**Parameters:**

- `v`: Protocol version (`1.0.0`)
- `k`: Key type (`rsa`)
- `p`: Public key (base64-encoded, SPKI format, no PEM headers/footers)

**Example TXT Record:**

```
v=1.0.0; k=rsa; p=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA...
```

---

## üåê DNS TXT Host Discovery Record and Selector for encryption (BTPS Server Location)

Used to resolve the BTPS server endpoint for a given **domain** (not selector-based) and also used for discovering the selector by the sender

### Naming Convention

```
_btps.host.<identity_domain>
```

**Example:**

```
_btps.host.vendorcorp.com
```

### TXT Record Format

```
v=1.0.0; u=<btps_host:port> s=<selector>
```

**Parameters:**

- `v`: Protocol version (`1.0.0`)
- `u`: BTPS server host and port (e.g., `btps.vendorcorp.com:3443`). Default port is `3443` if not present.
- `s`: BTPS selector (e.g., `btps1`)

**Example TXT Record:**

```
v=1.0.0; u=btps.vendorcorp.com:3443 s=btps1
```

### Lookup Flow

1. Given identity: `billing$vendorcorp.com`
2. Extract domain: `vendorcorp.com`
3. Resolve `_btps.host.vendorcorp.com` ‚Üí host address and selector
4. Resolve `btps1._btps.identity.finance.vendorcorp.com` ‚Üí public key

This separation enables:

- Independent key rotation via `selector`
- Centralized host resolution per domain
- DNS compatibility across providers

## Message Envelope Format

All BTPS messages follow a standardized envelope structure:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "issuedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "id": "btps_1234567890abcdef",
  "type": "TRUST_REQ",
  "from": "billing$vendorcorp.com",
  "to": "pay$client.com",
  "document": {
    // Document-specific content (see Document Types section)
  },
  "signature": {
    "algorithm": "sha256",
    "value": "base64-encoded-signature",
    "fingerprint": "sha256-base64-fingerprint"
  },
  "encryption": {
    "algorithm": "aes-256-cbc",
    "encryptedPayload": "base64-encoded-encrypted-document",
    "encryptedKey": "base64-encoded-encrypted-key",
    "iv": "base64-encoded-initialization-vector"
  },
  "selector": "btps1",
  "delegation": {
    // only used for delegated artifacts
    "agentId": "agentId",
    "agentPubKey": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8A...\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----",
    "signedBy": "alice$saas.com",
    "issuedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "signature": {
      "algorithm": "sha256",
      "value": "base64-encoded-signature",
      "fingerprint": "sha256-base64-fingerprint"
    },
    "selector": "btps1",
    "attestation": {
      // only used for delegated artifacts which as delegated on behalf of original identity
      "issuedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "signedBy": "admin$saas.com",
      "signature": {
        "algorithm": "sha256",
        "value": "base64-encoded-signature",
        "fingerprint": "sha256-base64-fingerprint"
      },
      "selector": "btps1"
    }
  }
}
```

**Artifacts Fields:**

- `version`: Protocol version (currently "1.0")
- `issuedAt`: ISO 8601 timestamp of message creation
- `id`: Unique message identifier (UUID v4 recommended)
- `type`: Message type (see Artifact Types section)
- `from`: Sender's BTPS identity address
- `to`: Recipient's BTPS identity address
- `document`: The actual document content
- `signature`: Cryptographic signature for authenticity
- `encryption`: Encryption details (null for unencrypted messages)
- `delegation`: Artifacts that was delegated for agents

## Artifact Types

BTPS supports three primary artifact types and different Doc types within each artifact types:

### 1. Transporter Artifact (`BTPTransporterArtifact`)

Transporter related artifacts are used for sending to receivers server. Mostly used server to server communication. Some instances when E2E or BYOK users may use this type artifact directly from client to server which removes server dependencies once setup properly.

### 2. Agent Artifact (`BTPAgentArtifact`)

Agent artifacts types are used for communicating from client to their identity host server. Most use cases are mobile/portable devices identities communicating to their own server communication.

### 3. IdentityLookup Artifact (`BTPIdentityLookupRequest`)

IdentityLookup artifacts are used for requesting identity public records for those identity records that are not published in DNS records. Commonly used for users operating under SaaS domain. eg: `john$ebilladdress.com`. Requires delegation support and identity storage at the implementing server.

### 4. Control Artifact (`BTPControlArtifact`)

These control artifacts are control based artifact such as pinging server and requesting graceful end session

### 5. Delivery Failure Artifact (`BTPDeliveryFailureArtifact`)

These are used for notifying the agent or client related to delivery failure. Not to be mistaken as server to server communication as this is usually used when queue artifacts could not be delivered to receiver server or receiver sent an error upon receiving by the implementing server to notify its agents by directly adding to inbox storages.
