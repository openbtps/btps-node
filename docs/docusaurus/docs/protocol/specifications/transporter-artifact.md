# Transporter Artifact Specification

Transporter artifacts are the primary mechanism for server-to-server communication in the BTPS protocol. They enable secure document delivery between trusted organizations and support various document types including trust requests, trust responses, and business documents like invoices.

## Overview

Transporter artifacts (`BTPTransporterArtifact`) are designed for automated server-to-server communication where organizations exchange sensitive business documents. They require established trust relationships and support end-to-end encryption for secure document transmission.

### 3. BTPS Document (`BTPS_DOC`)

Generic BTPS documents, most commonly invoices. An invoice is `"type": "invoice"`.

```json
{
  "type": "invoice",
  "title": "Invoice #INV-2025-001",
  "id": "INV-2025-001",
  "issuedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "dueAt": "2025-02-15T10:30:00Z",
  "totalAmount": {
    "amount": 150000,
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "lineItems": {
    "columns": ["Description", "Quantity", "Unit Price", "Amount"],
    "rows": [
      {
        "Description": "Web Development Services",
        "Quantity": "1",
        "Unit Price": 150000,
        "Amount": 150000
      }
    ]
  },
  "issuer": {
    "name": "Acme Corporation",
    "email": "billing@acme.com",
    "phone": "+1-555-0123",
    "address": "1 Main Street, Springfield",
    "identifiers": { "us:ein": "12-3456789" }
  },
  "paymentLink": {
    "linkText": "Pay Invoice",
    "url": "https://pay.acme.com/inv/INV-2025-001"
  },
  "description": "Monthly web development services for January 2025",
  "attachments": [
    {
      "content": "base64-encoded-pdf-content",
      "type": "application/pdf",
      "filename": "invoice-INV-2025-001.pdf",
      "size": 48213,
      "sha256": "lowercase-hex-sha256-of-the-file"
    }
  ],
  "template": {
    "name": "standard-invoice",
    "data": {
      "logoUrl": "https://acme.com/logo.png",
      "footerText": "Thank you for your business"
    }
  },
  "metadata": { "acme:orderId": "PO-7731" }
}
```

**Required Fields:**

- **type**: `invoice`
- **title**: Document title
- **id**: The invoice number, unique per sender
- **issuedAt**: ISO timestamp of document creation
- **totalAmount**: Total amount in integer minor units of its currency (`150000` USD is 1,500.00), with the currency. Minor units are those of ISO 4217: the currency fixes how many decimal places the amount has (2 for USD, 0 for JPY, 3 for KWD). BTPS carries the whole number and the code and never converts; turning it into a decimal for display is the platform's job, using ISO 4217's minor units (not `Intl.NumberFormat`'s display digits, which differ for some currencies, such as IDR and HUF)
- **lineItems**: Document line items with columns and rows. A money cell is an integer in minor units; a decimal such as a quantity is written as text

**Optional Fields:**

- **dueAt**: Payment due date (ISO format)
- **issuer**: Document issuer information, with an optional `address` and `identifiers` (company and tax ids by namespaced key, e.g. `au:abn`)
- **paymentLink**: Payment link information
- **description**: Document description
- **attachments**: Files carried with the document. `size` (bytes) and `sha256` (lowercase hex) are what the sender states; the protocol does not check the files
- **references**: Links to other signed documents, each `{ type, from, id, sha256 }`. `type` is `correction_of`, `credits`, `instalment_of`, `follows`, or a platform's own code under a prefix
- **template**: Document template and data
- **metadata**: The sending platform's own data; carried and signed, never read by the protocol

A document carries no status: whether an invoice is paid, partly paid, disputed or refunded comes from the lifecycle events exchanged about it. The schema is strict, so a field it does not name (such as 1.0's `status`) is refused.

## Security Features

### Digital Signatures

All transporter artifacts must be digitally signed using SHA-256 with RSA, The signature covers the entire message envelope excluding the signature field itself.

### Encryption

Transporter artifacts support optional encryption using AES-256-GCM:

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM
- **Encryption Types**: `none`, `standardEncrypt`, `2faEncrypt`
- **Key Exchange**: RSA-OAEP or ECDH
- **IV**: Random initialization vector
- **Auth Tag**: GCM authentication tag for integrity
- **Content**: Base64 encoded encrypted payload

### Trust Verification

Before processing any transporter artifact, the receiving server must:

1. Verify the sender's digital signature
2. Check if a trust relationship exists
3. Validate the trust relationship status
4. Verify the sender's public key matches the trust record

## Delegation Support

Transporter artifacts can include delegation information for agent-based operations:

- **agentId**: Unique identifier for the agent
- **agentPubKey**: Agent's public key
- **signedBy**: Main identity that signed the delegation
- **signature**: Digital signature of the delegation
- **attestation**: Optional attestation from a higher authority

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios

- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid signature or untrusted sender
- **403 Forbidden**: Trust relationship not established or blocked
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid message format or missing required fields
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server processing error
- **429 Too Many Requests**: Rate limiting exceeded

### Retry Logic

Failed deliveries should implement exponential backoff retry logic:

1. Initial retry after 1 minute
2. Subsequent retries with exponential backoff (2, 4, 8, 16 minutes)
3. Maximum retry attempts: 5
4. Final failure notification after all retries exhausted

## Implementation Guidelines

### Server Requirements

- Must validate all incoming transporter artifacts
- Must verify sender trust before processing
- Must implement proper error handling and logging
- Must support retry mechanisms for failed deliveries
- Must maintain audit trails for all transactions

### Client Requirements

- Must generate unique artifact IDs
- Must sign all outgoing artifacts
- Must handle trust establishment before sending documents
- Must implement proper retry logic for failed deliveries
- Must validate server responses and handle errors appropriately
