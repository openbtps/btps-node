## 🔒 How Does BTPS Work?

1. **Identity & Discovery:**
   - Every participant publishes a DNS TXT record and optional `.well-known` trust file, advertising their public key and inbox endpoint.
   - Addresses look like `username$domain.com` (e.g., `billing$vendorcorp.com`).
2. **Trust Establishment:**
   - Senders must request trust from receivers before sending business documents.
   - Receivers approve, reject, or block senders. Only trusted senders can deliver documents.
3. **Secure Message Exchange:**
   - All messages are signed and encrypted using strong cryptography (RSA, Ed25519, AES-256, etc.).
   - Servers verify sender identity, trust status, and document integrity before accepting any message.
4. **Key Rotation & Revocation:**
   - Key changes are managed via DNS and `.well-known` records. Trust can be revoked or expired at any time.
5. **Extensible & Auditable:**
   - Plug in custom trust stores (file, SQL, NoSQL, cloud), middleware, and integrations (webhooks, metrics, etc.).
   - All trust and message operations are logged for audit and compliance.

## Architecture Components

> The BTPS protocol is built from several modular components, each responsible for a critical aspect of secure, trust-based document exchange. This section provides an overview of the core protocol, identity system, trust management, and supporting SDKs and tools that make BTPS robust and extensible.

### Core Protocol

> Defines the rules, message formats, and cryptographic operations that ensure all BTPS communications are secure, verifiable, and interoperable.

- **Message formats and artifacts structure:** Defines the standard structure for all BTPS artifacts, including documents, encryption, and signature fields. Ensures interoperability and consistent validation across all implementations.
- **Trust establishment and verification flows:** Outlines the handshake and approval process for establishing trust between parties, including request, verification, approval/rejection, and storage of trust records. Guarantees that only approved senders can deliver documents.
- **Cryptographic operations (signing, encryption, verification):** Utilizes strong cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES-256-CBC, RSA, SHA-256) for signing, encrypting, and verifying messages. Ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of all communications.
- **Error handling and response codes:** Standardizes error responses and codes for all protocol operations, making it easier to debug, monitor, and automate error recovery.

### Identity System

> Provides decentralized, DNS-based identity management and public key distribution, enabling secure onboarding and ongoing verification of all participants.

- **DNS-based identity resolution:** Uses DNS TXT records and `.well-known` endpoints to publish and discover public keys and inbox endpoints. Enables decentralized, federated identity management without a central authority.
- **Public key distribution via DNS TXT records:** Ensures that public keys are easily discoverable and verifiable by any party, supporting secure onboarding and key rotation.
- **Key rotation and management:** Allows organizations to rotate cryptographic keys regularly for forward secrecy and to respond to key compromise. Key history is maintained for audit and compliance.
- **Identity verification procedures:** Provides mechanisms for verifying the authenticity of sender and receiver identities using cryptographic proofs and DNS-based validation.

### Trust Management

> Manages the lifecycle of trust relationships, from onboarding to revocation, and enforces trust-based access control for all document exchanges.

- **Trust stores (file-based, database, cloud):** Supports multiple storage backends for trust records, from simple JSON files for small deployments to scalable databases or cloud storage for enterprises.
- **Trust lifecycle (request, accept, reject, revoke, block, expire):** Manages the full lifecycle of trust relationships, including onboarding, active use, revocation, and expiration. Ensures that trust is always explicit and up-to-date.
- **Trust verification for message processing:** Every incoming message is checked against the trust store to ensure it comes from an approved sender. Untrusted or expired relationships are automatically rejected.
- **Trust audit and compliance:** All trust changes (creation, update, revocation) are logged for auditability and regulatory compliance. Supports reporting and monitoring for security teams.

### SDK & Tools

> Provides libraries, command-line tools, and extensibility hooks to make it easy for developers and operators to integrate, automate, and extend BTPS in any environment.
